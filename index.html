  <h1>Topics I Enjoyed the Most</h1>
  <p>I really enjoyed learning about HTML and how web pages are built. It was exciting to see how simple tags can create headings, paragraphs, images, and even interactive features on a website.</p>

  <h1>Topics I Want to Learn More About</h1>
  <p>I want to learn more about CSS and JavaScript. Styling the web page with colors and animations looks fun, and JavaScript seems powerful for making pages interactive and dynamic.</p>

  <h1>Topics I Thought Were Difficult</h1>
  <p>At first, understanding how CSS selectors work and how to structure HTML correctly was challenging. I had to re-read examples and practice a lot to make things appear the way I wanted them to on the page.</p>
